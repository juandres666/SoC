Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   34
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,133 out of   9,312   12%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,130 out of   9,312   22%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,550 out of   4,656   33%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,550 out of   1,550 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,550   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,200 out of   9,312   23%
    Number used as logic:             1,663
    Number used as a route-thru:         70
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      83

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 20 out of     232    8%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of RAMB16s:                      8 out of      20   40%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
