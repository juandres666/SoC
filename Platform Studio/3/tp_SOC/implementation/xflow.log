INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

All constraints were met.
INFO:Timing:2761 - N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the 
   constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this 
   constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This 
   constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec 
   Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.

INFO:Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).
INFO:Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths
   option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the
   unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a
   50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and
   for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please
   see the device datasheet.
INFO:Timing:3390 - This architecture does not support a default System Jitter
   value, please add SYSTEM_JITTER constraint to the UCF to modify the Clock
   Uncertainty calculation.
INFO:Timing:3389 - This architecture does not support 'Discrete Jitter' and
   'Phase Error' calculations, these terms will be zero in the Clock Uncertainty
   calculation.  Please make appropriate modification to SYSTEM_JITTER to
   account for the unsupported Discrete Jitter and Phase Error.
