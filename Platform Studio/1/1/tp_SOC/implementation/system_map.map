Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           642 out of   9,312    6%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,818 out of   9,312   19%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,126 out of   4,656   24%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,126 out of   1,126 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,126   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,856 out of   9,312   19%
    Number used as logic:             1,359
    Number used as a route-thru:         38
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      75

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 10 out of     232    4%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of RAMB16s:                      8 out of      20   40%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      20   15%
