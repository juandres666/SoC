Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           863 out of   9,312    9%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,908 out of   9,312   20%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,304 out of   4,656   28%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,304 out of   1,304 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,304   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,946 out of   9,312   20%
    Number used as logic:             1,441
    Number used as a route-thru:         38
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      83

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 18 out of     232    7%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of RAMB16s:                      8 out of      20   40%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      20   15%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.22
