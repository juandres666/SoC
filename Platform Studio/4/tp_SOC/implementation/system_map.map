Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,619 out of   9,312   17%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,832 out of   9,312   30%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,819 out of   4,656   39%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,819 out of   1,819 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,819   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,873 out of   9,312   30%
    Number used as logic:             2,301
    Number used as a route-thru:         41
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     147

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
